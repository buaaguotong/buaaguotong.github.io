title: "Flight Delay Prediction for Multiple Major Hub Airport"
excerpt: "This project revolves around delay prediction at major hub airports, integrating spatial correlations among multipleairports, including air traffic flow, geographic distances, and the temporal characteristics of each airport.It predicts the potential future delay durations of each airport, providing critical situational information forair traffic management systems. In this project, a Granger causality self-correcting spatial correlation extractionmodule was designed, utilizing graph convolution for spatial correlation modeling. Subsequently, spatialcorrelations and temporal features are integrated in a GRU model to predict future delays. The project wasintegrated into the East China Air Traffic Management Bureauâ€™s system. During the landing of TyphoonChanthu in Shanghai in 2021, the system accurately predicted delays at eight major hub airports includingShanghai, Zhengzhou, and Chengdu, achieving a prediction accuracy rate of 89%. <br/><img src='/images/Flight_delay.png'>"
