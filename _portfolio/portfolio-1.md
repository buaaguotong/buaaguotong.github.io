title: "Optimization and Scheduling of Urban Logistics UAVs"
excerpt: "Designed mathematical models and algorithms for logistics hub node selection and multi-aircraft safe interval maintenance in urban low-altitude logitstics systems. Developed a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model balancing UAV safety and logistics network costs, coupled with a memetic optimization algorithm using adaptive operator selection. The model and algorithm were integrated into the General Aviation Supervision System, deployed in pilot regions like Sichuan and Zhejiang, safeguarding 500,000 flights. They also supported operations and product development for leading enterprises, such as Hangzhou Xunyi Technology, delivering significant social and economic benefits <br/><img src='/images/Logistic_UAV.png'>)"
