title: "Optimization and Scheduling ofLarge-Scale ATFM"
excerpt: "This project focuses on optimizing flight traffic flow within Chinese major airport network by adjusting flightdeparture times, flight paths, and airspeeds, while minimizing flight conflict risks and delays. To addressthe challenges of high-dimensional optimization variables and the convergence speed required for real-timeoperations in civil aviation, a large-scale cooperative co-evolutionary optimization algorithm was proposed,utilizing flight spatiotemporal variable grouping. This approach reduced flight plan optimization time fromhours to within 10 minutes. The model and algorithm have been applied and validated in the flight flowmanagement systems of the East China and Northeast China Air Traffic Management Bureaus, significantlyreducing the frequency of slot adjustments and improving the operational efficiency of the air traffic system. <br/><img src='/images/ATFM.png'>"
